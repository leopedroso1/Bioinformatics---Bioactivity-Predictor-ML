 * Type of Project: Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence
 * Programming Languages: Python 
 * Machine Learning project for molecular bioactivity protein predictions towards inhibition of enzymes. 

### Briefly, in medications research in order to check if some medicine works against some disease, it is necessary to perform an analysis of the level of inhibition of enzymes (drug action) towards the molecular bioactivity of proteins from some patogen (virus, bacteria etc). To predict this bioactivity, likelihood of some medication works with as few side effects as possible, we can use machine learning using as input the molecules dataset from ChemBL.

- Step 1. Bioactivity Data: Extract data from ChemBL
- Step 2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Calculation of Lapinsky + PopCan Fingerprints molecule descriptors
- Step 3. Dataset Preparation: Prepare data for ML model
- Step 4. Model Establishment + Comparison
- Step 5. Improve Model Performance: Tuning random forest regressor hyperparameters 
- Step 6. Web App for dynamic analysis - Under Construction
